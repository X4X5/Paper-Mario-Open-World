# Paper Mario Open World
 Not a full blown mod, just wanting to do something that's not TSS lol
 
# What is this?
This is (hopefully going to be) my compilation of maps that I just fuck around with. Nothing serious, per se, but I'm currently learning to make maps, and the scripting that comes with it. I called this "open world" because there's literally going to be no story that comes with this. Just Mario walking around some random world.
